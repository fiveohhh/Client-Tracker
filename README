check for a user in the hold area when loading a client
work on XML serialization and 
deserialization
figure out how we want to do time.. round up to closest 7 mins?

Need to find a way to login as a user.  Maybe Password, store the hash in the users xml?  
disable everything on load until user has been registered?
